Memory Storage:

data goes into the memory address(variables, primitive, etc.), this then determines the memory storage that the code uses.
1 byte = 8 bits
EXAMPLE: int var = 5, contains 5 bytes of storage.

SAV means:
Save - Creating inputs and outputs to test
Action - Feed inputs to the function tested
Verify - Compare actual outputs with expected outputs

Object Oriented Programming is helpful to keeping group related information together.

Class: Is a template
Object: Concrete object

A class has behaviors or variables in which the class follows and has. Class methods are really actions of the object of the class.

Inheritance: best used when multiple classes have duplicated variables that are the same within those classes.

-The base class is what is made to help reduce the duplicated variables found within the subclasses.
-base classes has its base class constructors and possibly functions as well.

To summarize inheritance it is a...
-base class and its subclasses or derived classes
-can use super to access the base class
-DOES NOT support inheritance from multiple classes though

Override vs Overload:

Override:
Re-implement a function in derived class from base class with the...
-same name
-same signature
EXAMPLES: equal() and toString() functions are overrided

Overload:
Re-implement a function in the same class...
-same name
-different signatures
